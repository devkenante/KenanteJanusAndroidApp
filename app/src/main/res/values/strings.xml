<p style="line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &#39Times New Roman&#39,serif; color: black;">How Information Is Used:</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &#39Times New Roman&#39,serif; color: black;"><br /><em>The Information We Collect and How We Use It</em><br /><br />When you register as a panel member, we collect the following personal identifying information: your name, postal service address, email address, and phone number.<br /><br />We use your name and email address to let you know about opportunities to take surveys/contests, to provide new updates about&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;that may be of interest to our panellists and to inform you about special programs and benefits we are offering to our panel members (such as special gifts or incentives). Generally, panel members are notified about an opportunity to take a survey/contest several times per month. We also send brief emails to our interactive panel members several times a year to provide information of interest and to express our appreciation for their participation.<br /><br />We use postal service addresses to mail free gifts offered to panel members, products to test, and/or merchandise that you redeem with your Reward Points. Products to test and cash redemptions may be mailed directly to panel members by the&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;team and thus do not require sharing of your name and address with outside parties. However, your name, postal service address and email address may also be shared with&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;reward suppliers when you redeem your Rewards. Points so they can ship to you directly. Occasionally, we ask our interactive panel members if they would be willing to take certain special paper and pencil surveys/contests. We ask your permission prior to mailing such surveys/contests or sending our representative to your address with prior appointment, as well as providing information about the benefits of taking such a survey/contest.&nbsp;<br /><br />We call panel members in response to their request for a return call to answer a question or address any concerns. We also call panel members for answering some surveys/contests which need quick responses or need detailed interaction which cannot be done through our app or website only. On rare occasions, we call panelists to validate survey/contest responses.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;frequently asks panel members for demographic information (e.g., age, gender, household composition, etc.), computer and web access capabilities, and lifestyle information (e.g., types of vehicles owned or business/recreational travel, etc.).&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;uses this information to select surveys/contests that are appropriate for the panel member (or a member of the panelists household). For example, a survey/contest related to satisfaction with stays at various hotel chains might be sent only to those panelists who indicate a certain frequency of travel. We sometimes use birth date information to send birthday greetings to our panel members.<br /><br /><strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;asks panel members for their opinions about a variety of products and services by asking them to complete surveys/contests via the&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;app or website or over a call. Usually,&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong> combines the individual panelist responses and reports on the aggregated (or group) results. Individual level responses are occasionally used, but in general not associated with any personal identifying information without your explicit consent.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;may occasionally ask for personal identifying information as part of a specific survey/contest . In these cases, we will provide an explanation in the survey/contest introduction to allow panel members to make an informed decision about participation. The explanation will include a description of any new personal identifying information that will be collected via the survey/contest and with whom it will be shared. As with any survey/contest , members can decline to take the survey/contest or stop at any time during the survey/contest process. Like all other information we collect, any personal identifying information collected for a specific survey/contest will be used for research purposes only.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;also automatically collects information via log files to administer the app and the site and to aid in technical problem solving. Log file information collected is IP address, time a page was viewed, name of pages viewed within the&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;site during the specific visit, browser type, URL parameters, and cookies that were set by the&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;website at the time of the visit. Log files may also include information indicating where a visitor came from. This information is used only to administer the site and to identify and resolve any technical problems related to the site&#39s operation.<br /><br />When you participate in the Refer-a-Friend Program we ask for your friend&#39s first name and email address. The first name is used in the greeting to personalize the message and the email address is needed to deliver it to your friend. Both pieces of information are only stored long enough to make sure the email was sent without difficulty and never used for any other purpose. Participation in the referral program, like all aspects of&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;membership, is completely voluntary.<br /><br />This app and the website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Panel member names, postal service addresses, and phone numbers are maintained on a secured database accessible only by Varenia CIMS staff. Panel members may also access their own information for the purposes of verifying and updating, but they cannot view other members&#39 information. As with any Internet endeavor, absolute security of information transmitted through channels (communication networks, hardware, software) not directly operated or controlled by us cannot be guaranteed.<br /><br />In the event we or our affiliates experience a merger, acquisition, sale or other transaction pursuant to which this website is acquired by a third party or another affiliate, your personal identifying information may be disclosed to the third party or affiliate both before and after the transaction, for the sole purpose of facilitating and effecting that transaction. In the event a transaction is consummated, you will be notified of the transaction via email and/or through a notice on our app or website, and custody of your personal identifying information will be transferred subject to all the terms and restrictions in this privacy policy.<br /><br /><strong>Updating Your Personal Information:</strong><br /><em>Policies on Correcting/Updating Personal Identifying Information</em><br /><br /><strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;relies on panel members themselves to provide any updates to personal identifying information. Members may update email addresses, password, postal service address, phone number as well as name of the person who initially registered by going to the Update Your Info section of this website (available to members only). Please ensure that you change your password regularly to optimize the security of your account. For changes to any other personal identifying information, including email address, panel members are asked to edit information in the my profile page of the&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;app or website.&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;may also exchange information with our partner sites for the member&#39s benefit and with the member&#39s knowledge (in accordance with this privacy policy). These benefits include opportunities to earn additional rewards on the partner site and/or to eliminate&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;advertising to those who are already&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;members. The information exchanged will be the member ID and/or email address (the minimum information needed to provide the benefit). We require our partner sites sign a written, legally binding agreement stipulating they will not share your individual identifying information and that it is to be used solely for the purpose of providing you with additional rewards and to eliminate redundant advertising.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Opt-Out Policy:</strong><br /><em>Your Decision Not To Participate</em><br /><br />Panel members may decline to respond to a survey/contest or opt to drop interactive panel membership at any time. Panelists who prefer not to complete a given survey/contest need not do so.<br /><br />Panelists who would like to withdraw their membership from the panel may do so at any time on the&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;app or Site. Panelists may withdraw membership by clicking on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the My Profile page in the member area of the&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;site or uninstalling the&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;mobile app. We will process all unsubscribe requests within 10 business days of receipt and usually within 48 hours of receipt.<br /><br />Upon receipt of the drop request,&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;may ask you to complete brief survey/contest about the reason(s) for discontinuing membership. This survey/contest is optional and does not involve any additional email; any results will help us improve panel members&#39 experience. Thereafter,&nbsp;<strong>Kenant&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;will stop sending survey/contest notifications.</span></p>

As necessary, we will provide a link to the partner&#39s privacy policy or to the policy pertaining to the particular study. This information will be available at the beginning of the survey/contest and consent will be asked from panel members.<br /><br /><strong>Updates to this Privacy Notice</strong></span></p>
